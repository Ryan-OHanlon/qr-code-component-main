## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

What I learned from this exercise is how important CSS is to manipulating text, images, and the importance of knowing how to create boxes using margins and padding.

My main challenge was trying to figure out how to create a box around the image and text while also creating a rounded white border. The code below is what I used to create the solution in the screenshot.

```css
.box{background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); height: auto; border-radius: 20px; margin: auto; width: 200px; height: auto; padding: 15px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to develop my knowledge of how to manipulate text and CSS height and width so they can be responsive between desktop and mobile.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS Box Sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp) - This helped me to understand how to create a box to surround the image and text.
